      "Environmental constraints on the timing of reproduction and predation risk limit the time females have in which to mate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, we found that females were equally accepting of males at high and low density despite males at high density expressing less preferred signals.\n",
      "Without assessing the early stages of mate choice, this result would appear puzzling – why might females “choose” less attractive males at high density when low search costs afford them an opportunity to search for higher quality males?\n",
      "Because male density on the breeding grounds strongly influences male sexual signalling strategies, both the apparent quality of available mates and mate encounter rates may vary across densities.\n",
      "\n",
      "If male competition alters signalling before females arrive on the breeding grounds, this may facilitate females choosing better mates at high density because competition limits males’ dishonesty.\n",
      "Why are males redder at low density?\n",
      "The pattern suggests one of two possibilities: 1) males may reduce their signalling effort at high density or 2) not be able to produce high intensity signals because of trade-offs with costly competition.\n",
